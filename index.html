    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <!-- Adding an about me link -->
    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

    <h3>A Brief Overview of my Past</h3>
    <p>This is my first paragraph, <em>very fun</em>! I am having so much fun revisiting 
        all the knowledge I used to have as a child. I hate that I didn't think
        web development would take off. <strong>What was I thinking?</strong> So much time wasted.
        I should've studied software engineering. Ugh, oh well. I'm still here.
    </p>

    <!-- Inserting an additional paragraph -->
    <!-- Don't Mind Me -->

    <h3>What I am up to Now</h3>
    <p>Formalities out of the way, I am now working on becoming a software developer.
        Which is kinda crazy given that I have no experience with software developing
        outside of my high school experience. I will need to learn react, so I don't want to spend 
        too much time with HTML and CSS. I will give it a week then move onto JavaScript.
    </p>
